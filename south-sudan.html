              I traveled to South Sudan on the second week of February 2025 to
              distribute sports equipment, telescopes, microscopes, maps, and
              globes that you the Good Samaritans donated. I thank you from the
              bottom of my heart for your generous support. The kids were
              excited to see the soccer balls and other sports gear. They wasted
              no time but headed to the soccer grounds.
            </p>

              I asked a friend to take pictures of kids playing soccer, but he
              unfortunately didnâ€™t know how to operate the iPhone. He thought he
              recorded a video but did not. The two schools, Lorege Primary and
              Piobokoi Primary Schools had a total enrollment of over 600
              students each, including two nurseries. has 20 teachers. Nine
              teachers are on the government payroll and have not been paid for
              over 15 months. Eleven (11) teachers are volunteers. Despite the
              challenges faced by the teachers, they continue to devote
              themselves to teaching. The students are learning useful skills. I
              took it upon myself to randomly test pupils reading skills
              (Grades, 2 5, and 8). Grades 5 and 8 pupils excelled in reading
              skills. Grade 2 pupils' reading skills were poor.
