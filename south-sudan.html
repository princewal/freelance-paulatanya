              I traveled to South Sudan on the second week of February 2025 to
              distribute sports equipment, telescopes, microscopes, maps, and
              globes that you the Good Samaritans donated. I thank you from the
              bottom of my heart for your generous support. The kids were
              excited to see the soccer balls and other sports gear. They wasted
              no time but headed to the soccer grounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked a friend to take pictures of kids playing soccer, but he
              unfortunately didn't know how to operate the iPhone. He thought he
              recorded a video but did not. The two schools, Lorege Primary and
              Piobokoi Primary Schools had a total enrollment of over 600
              students each, including two nurseries. has 20 teachers. Nine
              teachers are on the government payroll and have not been paid for
              over 15 months. Eleven (11) teachers are volunteers. Despite the
              challenges faced by the teachers, they continue to devote
              themselves to teaching. The students are learning useful skills. I
              took it upon myself to randomly test pupils reading skills (Grades
              2, 5, and 8). Grades 5 and 8 pupils excelled in reading skills.
              Grade 2 pupils' reading skills were poor.

              Teachers in both schools had not been paid for over 15 and 24
              months. The teachers, the students, and the community have been
              left to their own devices. A trained teacher is paid an average of
              67,000 South Sudanese Pounds per month—a sum equivalent to 12 USD.
              The monthly salary cannot sustain a family of one let alone a
              large family. A teacher would have to work three months to afford
              to buy 50 kilograms of maize flour to feed their family. The
              situation is dire and pathetic!
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked her another question: "On a personal level, what would
              motivate you to come and teach daily?""
            </p>
            <p>
              Her answer: "If I could get help, say, to buy soap to wash my
              child, to buy food to feed my family, I would not miss a single
              day to come and teach."

              In my efforts to help the children out I am collecting bottles,
              cans, and anything that can be recycled to raise money. Using
              funds from the bottle drive, I purchase essential
              supplies—corrugated iron sheets, cement, timber, nails, and
              more—to build durable concrete classrooms. This isn't a temporary
              fix; it's a sustainable model where every brick laid is a
              commitment to the future of our children.
            </p>
            <p>
              Join me in this grassroots movement by supporting my cause and
              purchasing my books, with proceeds reinvested into these school
              projects. Together, we can change lives—one bottle, one brick, and
              one classroom at a time.
