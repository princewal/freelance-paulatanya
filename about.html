              My name is Paul Atanya. I am a writer and a man of many interests.
              Depending on the genre, my goal for writing is to inspire, inform,
              and entertain my readers. Most importantly, success for my fellow
              humans is what I desire and long for the most. There is a reason
              for this kind of thinking or philosophy. Each of us has a story
              within us to share with fellow humans.
            </p>
            <p>
              I write across genres, blending fiction with nonfiction to address
              universal themes such as personal growth, social change, and the
              human spirit. Whether telling fictional tales or offering
              practical advice, my goal is to empower readers to lead
              successful, meaningful lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have published four works, ranging from fiction to nonfiction.
              My published books are
              <a href="https://a.co/d/6w3V2XU">BLOODSHED In Mana</a> (fiction),
              <a href="https://a.co/d/h30Y65M" target="_blank"
                >DESTINATION CANADA: Tools for Success</a
              >
              (non-fiction),
              <a href="https://a.co/d/9XIDeAs"
                >RWATAMOE: A Name, Character, and a Destiny</a
              >
              (short story), and “Bill Fellows” (fiction), in an anthology, Oh!
              What a Character. My soon-to-be-published novel is Love on the
              Nile (in progress). I have completed over eight manuscripts that
              will be published in the not-too-distant future.
            </p>
            <p>
              I consider myself successful in many respects. Bragging is not
              meant here. I am proud of my ability to inspire my clients,
              colleagues, and people I meet, young or old. It gives me great
              pleasure to share ideas that lead to the success of people I
              associate with. As a philanthropist and volunteer, I have
              collected bottles, cans, and anything that can be recycled to
              raise money and built an elementary school in a remote,
              impoverished community in the Republic of South Sudan. Doing so
              led to my nomination for Canada’s Champions of Change (2006), an
              organisation tasked with recognising and honouring Canadian
              volunteers in Canada and abroad for their volunteerism in
              bettering needy communities. My unpublished book, Turning Bottles
              and Into School, will be heading to the press soon. My meeting
              with Mother Teresa of the Sisters of Charity in Khartoum, Sudan
              (1987), inspired me to help others by giving back to the
              community.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my creative, writing, and musical abilities, I
              serve as a youth mentor and an advocate for girls' education,
              especially in developing disadvantaged and impoverished
              communities in developing countries. Every year, I organise a book
              sale to sell my books and donate the proceeds to buy soccer balls,
              writing materials, and sports uniforms for school-aged pupils.
              Doing led to my awarding the Judge J. Elliott Hudson Distinguished
              Alumni Award (June 2024), University of Kings College, Halifax,
              Nova Scotia, for contributing to his career and the community.
