              Hello Reader: <br />
              I have a story to tell you. It is a personal story for writing
              <a href="https://a.co/d/h30Y65M" target="_blank"
                >DESTINATION CANADA: Tools for Succes</a
              >. This story is about success: a story of Canada and immigrants
              destined for Canada. I am an immigrant like you. I came to Canada
              not as an immigrant but to study. I fell in love with Canada,
              applied for permanent residency, and was granted Canadian
              citizenship. Before stepping foot in Canada, I learned that Canada
              offered the best first-class education in the world, a developed
              and peaceful country with a charter of rights and freedoms for its
              citizens. I found this to be true. What I did not know, however,
              was that it takes hard work and effort to build this country. It
              takes hard work to succeed economically or financially. It takes
              an effort to integrate into a new cultural environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote this book to dispel misinformation about this great
              country and to give you the facts to decide whether to immigrate.
              I wrote it to assist with making an informed choice about leaving
              your loved ones behind and immigrating to a new country. I have
              good news for you. Canada is the best country to immigrate to. I
              have lived in the country for 36 years, am a proud citizen, and am
              fully integrated in all respects. I love the country, its values,
              and its ideals. Besides, I am a career advisor and know how to
              navigate the employment and hiring process.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Canada is regarded as one of the best countries to immigrate
              to, it has its fair share of myths. I have learnt that Canada
              ‘raining money’ from the sky is one of its biggest myths. One must
              work to earn money. Sometimes, one must work two or three jobs to
              break even. Working long hours is not an exception. It is
              increasingly becoming the norm. Having a university degree is
              essential. A degree, diploma, or certificate is the base of
              knowledge; it is the foundation for pursuing a career in your area
              of expertise. Applying the knowledge learned, in addition to
              life-long learning, is critical to being current and maintaining
              one’s career and work longevity. Furthermore, unlike most
              countries, Canada is a skilled-based society and not so much a
              credential society. It is the experience and skill that Canadian
              employers would weigh in the hiring decision and not necessarily
              your degree or diploma.
            </p>
            <p>
              Canada presents a host of challenges for many immigrants. Language
              is one of them. It is tough to succeed in one’s profession even in
              the best of times, especially when one does not speak sufficient
              English or French. It is hard to navigate the world of work if one
              is not culturally competent. There are certain behaviours Canadian
              employers expect of fellow Canadians and newcomers. I offer
              solutions to these challenges in
              <a href="https://a.co/d/h30Y65M" target="_blank">
                DESTINATION CANADA: Tools for Success </a
              >. I have navigated through these cultural differences and
              embraced the nuances of the workplace culture with an effort to
              succeed. And so will you. If you want to settle, adjust, adapt,
              and integrate into the Canadian society successfully, I recommend
              you read my book.
            </p>
            <p>
              My final message and advice. Upon arrival in Canada, the first
              thing on your to-do list is to contact an immigrant service or
              government agency to utilise the services of a competent
              employment consultant. The career and employment consultant will
              guide you with what you need to secure employment in your desired
              profession or return to training. This could be language training
              or upgrading skills in your field of training. Looking for or
              finding a job in Canada is not easy. It takes skill. The book will
              help you understand the process. I wrote this book to cast aside
              many myths that potential immigrants have been led to believe
              about Canada. Know about your destination before deciding to
              immigrate. Canadian employers have certain expectations of the
              employees they would like to recruit, be they Canadian or
              immigrants. DESTINATION CANAD: Tools for Success will equip you
              with the knowledge and tools to succeed in your new country.
              Immigrate to Canada! Be well-informed with the mindset to succeed!
