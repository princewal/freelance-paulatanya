              <h3>- Lisa Marie (recent immigrant to Canada (7 years)</h3>
              <p>
                The Paul Atanya I have known for the past 7 years is not the
                same Paul Atanya I now know. After reading your book,
                DESTINATION CANADA: Tools for Success, I will no longer talk to
                you like I used to talk to Paul Atanya. I did not know. I will
                start talking to you as the real Paul—the Paul Atanya I now
                know. I will be taking you seriously. I feel guilty because I
                didn't buy your book, even when you suggested I buy and read
                your book. I remember telling you that I did not only 'have the
                time to read' but that 'I had not the time for myself'. What a
                pity!
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, I picked up a copy of your book from Roy's
                residence and read the introduction and the first chapter but
                couldn't stop. So, I took the book from his house and brought it
                to my house. What you have written about in your book highly
                resonates with me. And do you know why? If I had known who you
                are and had asked you about what I should do to advance my
                career in Canada, I would have obtained my bachelor's and
                master's degrees, or I would even be pursuing my PhD or working
                in an office. Here I am, working in a warehouse! I did not try
                to seek advice. I took you for granted.
              </p>
              <p>
                I just kept calling you to find out if you were free so I could
                drop by for a coffee, and you always said “yes”. Now, I realise
                that if I had known what a Career and Employment Consultant was
                all about, I would have advanced my career to the next level,
                found an office job, and not continued to work in a warehouse.
                That is not to say that a warehouse job is necessarily bad.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thank you, Paul, for making me see the light. Thank you for
                opening my eyes. I’m going to recommend your book to my friends.
                I won’t give them the current copy I’m reading to any of my
                friends for free, like I did. I will ask them to buy it.

                Dear Paul..., you assisted me with making my resume as concise
                as possible and gave me tips for finding a job. I got more than
                a job. I got respect, appreciation, and, most of all, a means of
                starting a new life [in Canada] with my dignity intact. I just
                wanted to say thank you. I am pleased to inform you that I am
                just three and a half weeks away from completing my six-month
                probation.

                The best thing I have ever done to myself since coming to Canada
                was to come to the Centre for Newcomers and talk to Paul. I
                received six interviews and four job offers.

                Hi Paul, I hope all is going well with you. I want to thank you
                for all your kind support. Finally, I found a job. After
                attending your workshop and receiving your valuable comments, I
                received many telephone calls to go for an interview. I got ten
                interviews and three brilliant offers. Thanks to you, Paul. You
                are a great man in resume writing and helping people.

                I was highly recommended to attend your workshop by a friend who
                had before attended your resume workshop. As a matter of fact,
                this is what is said: "Man, you must attend this guy's workshop.

                I find Paul a very effective speaker, and his workshop very
                clear, and I learned a lot. Maybe because it is his expertise. I
                noticed he is very patient and detailed and ensures his clients
                understand the material he is teaching.

                I am sorry I cannot attend your workshop today because I found a
                job. Please let it be recorded that I am the first Chinese in

                Hello Paul,<br />
                I wanted to take the opportunity to deeply thank you again for
                taking the time to see me on Thursday morning. It was incredibly
                generous of you to take the time out of your day and to suggest
                so many great options for my continued job search.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your advice has helped me immensely by both narrowing my focus
                and massively boosting my confidence. Before, I had shied away
                from pursuing work with the UN because I was under the
                impression that I was under-qualified, and that I would not have
                much to contribute to a large-scale organization conducting such
                important work on a global scale. After speaking with you, I now
                feel that I should absolutely "dream big" with both my
                short-term and long-term career goals. I know that I am capable
                of doing a lot of excellent work for any international or
                domestic organization concerned with the promotion of human
                rights and the well-being of people, and that this is where my
                passion is.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will begin my search for Staffan de Mistura's contact
                information on Monday, so I will be in touch with you again
                shortly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I have attached an electronic copy of my resume to
                this e-mail. Paul, thank you so much again for your time and
                consideration. It was such a pleasure to meet you. <br />Best,
              </p>
