                <h3>- Lisa Marie - recent immigrant to Canada (7 years)</h3>
                <p>
                  The Paul Atanya I have known for the past 7 years is not the
                  same Paul Atanya I now know. After reading your book,
                  DESTINATION CANADA: Tools for Success, I will no longer talk
                  to you like I used to talk to Paul Atanya, I did not know. I
                  will start talking to you as the real Paulâ€”the Paul Atanya I
                  now know. I will be taking you seriously. I feel guilty
                  because I didn't buy your book, even when you suggested I buy
                  and read your book. I remember telling you that I did not only
                  'have the time to read' but that 'I had not the time for
                  myself'. What a pity!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fortunately, I picked up a copy of your book from Roy's
                  residence and read the introduction and the first chapter but
                  couldn't stop. So, I took the book from his house and brought
                  it to my house. What you have written about in your book
                  highly resonates with me. And do you know why? If I had known
                  who you are and had asked you about what I should do to
                  advance my career in Canada, I would have obtained my
                  bachelor's and master's degrees, or I would even be pursuing
                  my PhD or working in an office. Here I am, working in a
                  warehouse! I did not try to seek advice. I took you for
                  granted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I just kept calling you to find out if you were free so I
                  could drop by for a coffee, and you always said "yes". Now, I
                  realise that if I had known what a Career and Employment
                  Consultant was all about, I would have advanced my career to
                  the next level, found an office job, and not continued to work
                  in a warehouse. That is not to say that a warehouse job is
                  necessarily bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thank you, Paul, for making me see the light. Thank you for
                  opening my eyes. I'm going to recommend your book to my
                  friends. I won't give them the current copy I'm reading to any
                  of my friends for free, like I did. I will ask them to buy it.

                  Dear Paul..., you assisted me with making my resume as concise
                  as possible and gave me tips for finding a job. I got more
                  than a job. I got respect, appreciation, and, most of all, a
                  means of starting a new life [in Canada] with my dignity
                  intact. I just wanted to say thank you. I am pleased to inform
                  you that I am just three and a half weeks away from completing
                  my six-month probation.

                  Hi Paul, I hope all is going well with you. I want to thank
                  you for all your kind support. Finally, I found a job. After
                  attending your workshop and receiving your valuable comments,
                  I received many telephone calls to go for an interview. I got

                  people.

                  I find Paul a very effective speaker, and his workshop very
                  clear, and I learned a lot. Maybe because it is his expertise.
                  I noticed he is very patient and detailed and ensures his
                  clients understand the material he is teaching.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Hello Paul,<br />
                  I wanted to take the opportunity to deeply thank you again for
                  taking the time to see me on Thursday morning. It was
                  incredibly generous of you to take the time out of your day
                  and to suggest so many great options for my continued job
                  search.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your advice has helped me immensely by both narrowing my focus
                  and massively boosting my confidence. Before, I had shied away
                  from pursuing work with the UN because I was under the
                  impression that I was under-qualified, and that I would not
                  have much to contribute to a large-scale organization
                  conducting such important work on a global scale. After
                  speaking with you, I now feel that I should absolutely "dream
                  big" with both my short-term and long-term career goals. I
                  know that I am capable of doing a lot of excellent work for
                  any international or domestic organization concerned with the
                  promotion of human rights and the well-being of people, and
                  that this is where my passion is.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will begin my search for Staffan de Mistura's contact
                  information on Monday, so I will be in touch with you again
                  shortly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, I have attached an electronic copy of my resume
                  to this e-mail. Paul, thank you so much again for your time
                  and consideration. It was such a pleasure to meet you.
                  <br />Best,
                </p>
